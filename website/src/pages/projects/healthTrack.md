HealthTrack is an app I worked on in a team of 6 people. It's designed to help people meet their fitness goals by allowing them to track their workouts and calculate how many calories they need to burn and how many they have burned already. The app stores user's information inside a Firebase database. By using firebase, we were also able to implement social features such as page where you can share workout plans with other users and a community page where challenges can also be shared to help motivate both yourself and others.
