Aiko is a Discord bot I created after noticing that many popular management bots require payment for certain features and that music bots have been shut down. Instead of finding another bot to use, I decided to create my own. Aiko not only includes basic moderation tools such as muting people and clearing messages but also has the ability to play music and offers fun features such as displaying motivational quotes on a scheduled time.
<br/><br/>

## Key Features
- User Management (e.g., welcome messages, role assignment)
- Custom Commands (e.g., -quote for displaying motivational quotes)
- Music Playback
- Daily Motivational Quotes
<br/><br/>

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend framework
- **Discord.js**: Discord API wrapper
- **JavaScript**: Language Used
<br/><br/>

The bot's code can be found on GitHub via the link below:
